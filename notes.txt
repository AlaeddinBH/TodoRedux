redux : state management library of javaScript(angular,react,vue,vanilla) ==> organize state and store in a single source
==> all state is stored in a store , and every component can access data


component ===> action ===> reducer ===> store
  data <==============================


  example : Bank
  customer : component
  withdraw money(200dt) : action
  Banker : reducer: accepts the action, modifies the store
  store (500dt) ==> 300dt


  action : object ==> two keys : type,payload
  ex:
  const withdraw_money = {
      type:"WITHDRAW_MONEY",
      payload:(optional)
  }


  reducer : function ===> state,action : parameters
  const reducer = (state,{type,payload}) => {
      switchcase
  }


  store : createStore(reducer)
